<p>UW-Madison students play an important part in keeping our community safe â€” including you.</p>

<p>Please answer these questions every day before you plan to come to campus.</p>

<p>Together we can keep our campus community safe:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Maintain physical distancing (minimum six feet) wherever possible.</li>
  <li>Face coverings are required to be worn in all campus indoor public spaces, including classrooms, and outside when physical distancing is not possible. Accommodations may be made for those unable to do this for disability, medical, or other reasons.</li>
  <li>Wash your hands often.</li>
</ul>
<p>Badgers take care of each other. If you need additional resources or help, contact:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.uhs.wisc.edu">University Health Services</a> <a href="tel:608-265-5600">608-265-5600</a></li>
